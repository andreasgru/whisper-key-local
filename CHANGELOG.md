# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),

## [0.8.2] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Text corrections** - Fix recurring misheard words with a user-defined list (`post_processing.corrections`): variants match case-insensitively and are replaced with your exact spelling — a deterministic backstop for jargon `whisper.hotwords` can't fix (#59, #60)
- **Terminal tab title status** - Tab title blinks a red dot while recording; indicator and animation per state are customizable via the new `terminal_title` config section (#61)
- **Startup ready sound** - Plays a short chime when the app finishes loading (`audio_feedback.ready_enabled`) (#62)
- **GPU failure recovery** - When GPU model loading fails, the app now offers to re-run GPU setup or fall back to CPU instead of crashing
- `post_processing.strip_trailing_period` config option to strip a trailing period from transcription output (#55)

### Changed
- **`recording_mode` now applies to the command hotkey** - push-to-talk works the same for voice commands as for transcription (#56)
- New `post_processing` config section owns output text transforms; transcribed text is now printed/logged after post-processing so the console always shows what gets pasted

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Push-to-talk mode** - New `hotkey.recording_mode` config: hold the recording hotkey to record, release to stop and transcribe (#45)
- **Console window management** - Two exe variants:
  - `whisper-key.exe` - runs in Windows Terminal with full color (same as before)
  - `whisper-key-hideable.exe` - conhost with hide-to-tray support (`console.start_hidden` config option) (#50)

### Fixed
- Stop key requiring two presses in toggle mode (#54)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **GPU onboarding** - Detects your GPU on first launch and offers one-press install of CUDA or ROCm runtime libraries. Supports NVIDIA, AMD RDNA 2+, and RDNA 1 (manual setup) (#44)
- **Auto-update** - Checks PyPI for new versions on startup with option to update in-place (#43)
- **GPU and runtime detection** - Shows GPU model and runtime status on startup (#41)
- **Overlay config** - Config updates now merge cleanly without overwriting user comments or structure (#40)
- `initial_prompt` config option to bias Whisper transcription toward expected content (#39)
- `log_transcriptions` config option (default: off) for privacy

### Changed
- **Replaced PyInstaller with pyapp** - Windows exe is now a single `whisper-key.exe` that bootstraps its own Python environment. No more zip extraction or separate AMD variant (#42)
- Updated README for new install flow

### Removed
- PyInstaller build system and related runtime hooks

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Custom hotwords** - Bias transcription toward specific words/phrases via `whisper.hotwords` config (#34)
- **Open model cache** shortcut in system tray menu
- CONTRIBUTING.md with PR guidelines

### Fixed
- **Portable exe crash on startup** - `commands.defaults.yaml` was not bundled in PyInstaller build, causing `[WinError 2]` crash when voice commands initialize (#37)
- Startup error handler now logs full traceback for better crash diagnostics

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Voice command mode** - Dedicated hotkey (`Alt+Win` / `Fn+Command`) records speech and matches against user-defined trigger phrases in `commands.yaml` (#33)
  - `run` action — execute shell commands (e.g., "open notepad" → `notepad.exe`)
  - `hotkey` action — send keyboard shortcuts (e.g., "undo" → `Ctrl+Z`)
  - `type` action — deliver pre-written text (e.g., "my email" → `user@example.com`)
  - Case-insensitive substring matching with longest-trigger-first priority
  - Auto-send support — press `Alt` to stop and send ENTER after type commands
- **Commands file shortcuts** in system tray menu for quick editing
- Terminal tab title set to "Whisper Key" on startup

### Changed
- **Hotkey config refactored** — replaced `stop_with_modifier` toggle with explicit `stop_key` and `auto_send_key` settings
- Recording hotkey is now start-only (no longer toggles)
- Cleaner console messages: one-line-per-hotkey format, indented recording output
- Renamed `documentation/` folder to `docs/`
- macOS config path moved to `~/.whisperkey`
- Updated GPU setup guide: simplified ROCm instructions, updated wheel versions

### Fixed
- ROCm runtime hook now finds pip-installed HIP SDK

## [0.6.3] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Direct text injection** - New `type` delivery method using native ctypes `SendInput` with `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE`, bypassing clipboard entirely (Windows only) (#21)
- **Configurable delivery method** - Choose between `paste` (clipboard + Ctrl+V) and `type` (direct key injection) via `clipboard.delivery_method`
- **Pre-paste delay** - `paste_pre_paste_delay` setting (50ms default) fixes intermittent empty paste caused by Windows Clipboard History service contention (#21)
- **Scaling auto-enter delay** - Type mode delay before Enter now scales with text length: `type_auto_enter_delay + chars/100 * type_auto_enter_delay_per_100_chars`
- **Real-time speech preview** - Experimental streaming transcription using sherpa-onnx (enable with `streaming.streaming_enabled: true`; downloads a small ~20MB model on first use)
- **Application icon** - PyInstaller exe now has a proper app icon
- **`wk` CLI alias** - Short command alias for `whisper-key`

### Fixed
- **Auto-paste empty text bug** - Clipboard race condition where Windows Clipboard History service contests clipboard between copy and paste, causing target app to receive nothing (#21)

### Changed
- Replaced pyautogui with native ctypes `SendInput` for keyboard simulation on Windows (smaller dependency footprint, atomic key injection)
- Restructured clipboard config: `paste_*` prefix for paste-mode settings, `type_*` for type-mode settings, `macos_*` for macOS-only
- Delivery method validation moved into platform keyboard modules
- Default `paste_clipboard_restore_delay` set to 0.5s

### Removed
- **pyautogui** dependency — replaced by native ctypes
